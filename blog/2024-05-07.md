Life got in the way, but I've picked up this project again.  

I've reduced the project scope to get something
that works reliably out the door feasible; this means that Mew will be based on
the .NET runtime, and as a first step, not generate CIL myself but 
transpile Mew to (non-optimal) C# code. This will hopefully make it easier
to get something out and experiment with the language.

I'm focusing on documenting every aspect of the language that I would want 
to see in the first version. Once that is done, I will open the repository 
and open-source the project. Hopefully other people can learn from all my mistakes.

:::note
Mew is a learning exercise in compilers and an experiment to see if I 
can create something usable, mostly from a scripting perspective.
