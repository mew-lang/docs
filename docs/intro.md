# Introduction

Mew is a imperative, non object-oriented programming language, mainly created for fun and non-profit.  
Useless? Yes, most probably. At least in the current state.

As a first step, Mew is transpiled to C#, but once things stabilize a bit, the Mew compiler should be able to emit CIL byte code, running on .NET as a first class citizen.

This site serves as the documentation over what we want to language to be in its first iteration.
